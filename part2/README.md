This is the second part for the homework. It is logical game, in which the player must solve 8 logical tasks (sentences) following the rules of three-valued logic which are loaded to the program from files and.txt, or.txt, impl.txt, not.txt. game.cpp can be compiled by g++ and run with parameters that specify file paths with definitions of logical operators e.g: ./game.exe --and and.txt --not not.txt --or or.txt --impl impl.txt
