# Logika-zadanie-3
This is the first task from the third homework for logic by Klaudia Knafel. It is prepared to by run on linux platform. 
The actual program is named condition.cpp. 
The program includes complicated logic condition for the parameters wchich are given to the program (6 intigers).
It checks whether the first one is less than the second one, the third one is different from zero and one of parameters (fourth or fifth or sixth) is evenly divisible by the third parameter. If the condition is fulfilled program returns first_parameter-second_parameter+fourth_parameter%third_parameter+fifth_parameter%thrid_parameter+sixth_parameter%third_parameter. In other case it returns first_parameter-second_parameter.
